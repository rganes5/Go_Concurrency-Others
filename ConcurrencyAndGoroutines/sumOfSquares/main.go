/*

I see the confusion. It seems like you're thinking that the function call `sumOfSquares(number, response, &wg)`
happens before sending the value to the `number` channel, but in reality,
the goroutine starts executing immediately after it's created. Here's the order of execution:

1. A goroutine is created with `go sumOfSquares(number, response, &wg)`.

2. Inside this goroutine, it starts executing the `sumOfSquares` function.

3. As part of the `sumOfSquares` function, it waits to receive a value from the `number` channel with `num := <-number`.

4. In the main goroutine, you send the value `value` into the `number` channel with `number <- value`.

5. The goroutine created in step 1 receives the value from the `number` channel, calculates the square, and sends the squared result to the `response` channel.

So, the function call and the value being sent to the channel do not happen in a sequential manner in the main goroutine.
 Instead, they happen concurrently. This is the power of goroutines in Go â€“ they can execute independently and concurrently, allowing you to perform tasks in parallel.
